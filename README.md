Here is my learning on socket programing. Based on a book called *TCP/IP网络编程* (ISBN 9787115358851).

The code is in c and not cross-platform. Here is code for linux. See the code for windows [here](../socket-programing-windows).

Most code is based on the book's chapter example code (Not all example code is contained). And I may have adjusted the code style based on my own habit or added some adjustment.
